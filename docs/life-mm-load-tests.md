# LIFE MM local load testing

Workload, commands and acceptance budgets for offline verification. Historical
results and measured fixes are in [the load report](../reports/life-mm-load-tests.md).

Run with the compiled environment and Docker available:

```sh
make build-cloudrun
make test-mm-load
# Short diagnostics only:
make test-mm-load MM_LOAD_PROFILE=probe
```

`CLOUDRUN_IMAGE` selects the deployment artifact. Full profiles pin its registry
manifest through a disposable loopback-only registry, then remove the registry.
Probe uses its immutable image ID and cannot count as final acceptance. Reports
are sanitized JSON under `build/mm-load/<run>/`; failures retain logs and exit
nonzero. Every test container/network is cleaned in `finally`. No local `.env`
or real exchange credentials are used. Application, PostgreSQL, exchange and
client run on an internal Docker network with dummy Demo credentials.

The gate reuses the deployment-image E2E harness, real OKX adapters, real recorder,
session/ownership guard, V2 executors and PostgreSQL schema runner. Its simulator
has no database access and records its own order/fill/fee/position truth. It is
scripted test infrastructure, not a matching engine. Runtime instrumentation is
an explicitly mounted test wrapper around the normal service entry point. It
measures SQL/pool/recorder/handler timing and book queues without replacing
trading decisions or adding a production metrics endpoint.

## Workload and resources

The bot has 1 CPU and 2 GiB; PostgreSQL has 2 CPUs / 512 MiB; simulator and load
client each have 1 CPU / 512 MiB. Swap limits equal memory limits. Record the host
architecture, amd64 emulation, immutable image identity, source/fixture hashes
and effective YAML. Seed 100,000 closed orders and 100,000 fills from yesterday,
using natural PostgreSQL NUMERIC units. Older recorded runs used the prior
scaled-six schema; each report retains its original image/schema scope. Both
markets and the deployed weighted basket run throughout the fixed workload. Tiny partial fills retain
the actual inventory/exposure limits without requiring unrealistic virtual capital.

- Warmup: 5 real minutes; mixed: another 15 real minutes. Ten FE workers receive
  an open-loop aggregate 20 reads/s, while the exchange sends 100 aggregate book
  updates/s and one valid partial fill/s. History pages include limits 1/100/500;
  daily statistics and cached V2 performance are polled alongside status/accounts.
- Bursts: 90 seconds, including 10 seconds at 500 book updates/s, older/duplicate
  fill replay, ten simultaneous retries of one command, ten stale-version
  conflicts, and actual switch/stop/start completion under concurrent reads.
- Soak: 60 real minutes in both markets, random steps every 600 seconds and a
  finite two-hour session. Rates are recorded across intentional admission gaps;
  the fixed mixed window is the sustained-rate acceptance window. Synthetic
  fills pause during the five seconds before a scheduled step handover and while
  admission is closed; the generator catches up afterward. This isolates healthy
  recovery from the separate fill-during-shutdown uncertainty/HALT regression.
- Separate 20-read/s fault windows interrupt a basket source, restart the owner,
  expire a session while book events queue, block DB reads with a real table
  lock and stop PostgreSQL. Fault errors are retained separately from healthy
  latency/error acceptance. After DB loss the service must fail closed and
  retain HALT on restart. Only the existing explicit test-only exposure-review
  helper can clear a test HALT between independent fault cases.

An observational reconciliation runs once per healthy window while fills may
continue. A concurrent-state `incomplete` report is valid; it must finish within
its existing bounds and never mutate control or trading state. End-of-window
checks compare independent unique fill identities, base/contract units, prices,
fees and actual perpetual positions with PostgreSQL/API observations. Daily
counts include both seeded history and live test fills, and real daily balance
snapshot writes must exist. FE polls must not create per-request exchange reads.

## Budgets declared before final execution

Healthy aggregate reads and command acceptance: p95 ≤500 ms, p99 ≤1 s and no
unexpected errors. Actual stop/cancel ≤5 s; actual start/switch ≤15 s. Record
per-route latency as well, so a slower individual endpoint remains visible.
Offered and achieved rates are separate. Market rate uses the simulator's
monotonic counter observation interval, with one four-book batch permitted at
the measurement boundary. A short diagnostic never replaces the full durations.

Burst book backlog must return to its steady queue within 10 seconds. Peak bot
RSS ≤1.5 GiB. Minute samples preserve CPU, RSS, loop lag, event age/backlog,
recorder latency, query counts, pool checkout latency and PG connections/locks.
Soak requires at least 55 minute samples. Comparing the first/last five samples,
median RSS growth must be ≤64 MiB, book backlog ≤max(10, initial+4), and pool
checkout p95 ≤max(20 ms, initial+5 ms). Pool timing includes pre-ping/checkout;
it is not a pure server execution measurement. Existing bounded query-count
checks remain: order pages ≤3 SQL statements, fills and cached performance ≤1.
